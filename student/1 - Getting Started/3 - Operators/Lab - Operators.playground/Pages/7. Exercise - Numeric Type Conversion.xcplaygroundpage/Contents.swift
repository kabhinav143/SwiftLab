## Exercise - Numeric Type Conversion

 Create an integer constant `x` with a value of 10, and a double constant `y` with a value of 3.2. Create a constant `multipliedAsIntegers` equal to `x` times `y`. Does this compile? If not, fix it by converting your `Double` to an `Int` in the mathematical expression. Print the result.
 */
let x:Double=10;
let y=3.2
let multipliedIntegers=x*y
print(multipliedIntegers)


//:  Are the values of `multipliedAsIntegers` and `multipliedAsDoubles` different? Print a statement to the console explaining why.
print("No both are different as they both are returning different values")
